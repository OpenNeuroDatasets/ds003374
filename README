# Dataset of neurons and intracranial EEG from human amygdala during aversive dynamic visual stimulation

## Summary
We present an electrophysiological dataset collected from the amygdalae of nine subjects attending a visual dynamic stimulation of emotional aversive content. The subjects were patients affected by epilepsy who underwent preoperative invasive monitoring in the mesial temporal lobe. Subjects were presented with dynamic visual sequences of fearful faces (aversive condition), interleaved with sequences of neutral landscapes (neutral condition).

We provide the recordings of intracranial EEG (iEEG) and metadata related to the task, subjects, sessions and electrodes in the BIDS standard.

We also provide a more extended version of the dataset that includes neuronal spike times and waveforms in the NIX standard under the folder "bidsignore/data_NIX". This extended dataset is also available in G-Node (https://gin.g-node.org/USZ_NCH/Human_Amygdala_MUA_sEEG_FearVideo/).

This dataset allows the investigation of amygdalar response to dynamic aversive stimuli at multiple spatial scales, from the macroscopic EEG to the neuronal firing in the human brain.
