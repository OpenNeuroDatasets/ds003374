# Dataset of neurons and intracranial EEG from human amygdala during aversive dynamic visual stimulation

## Summary
We present an electrophysiological dataset collected from the amygdalae of nine subjects attending a visual dynamic stimulation of emotional aversive content. The subjects were patients affected by epilepsy who underwent preoperative invasive monitoring in the mesial temporal lobe. Subjects were presented with dynamic visual sequences of fearful faces (aversive condition), interleaved with sequences of neutral landscapes (neutral condition).

The dataset contains the recordings of intracranial EEG (iEEG) and localization information for iEEG electrodes. Subject characteristics and trial information are provided. This dataset allows the investigation of amygdalar response to dynamic aversive stimuli in the human brain.
